### Quickstart

#### What You Need

- A server (for example, a server on Hetzner, DigitalOcean, Scaleway, etc.) with a public IP (at least one public IP per project), SSH access, and Ubuntu 22.04
- Dockerfile in the root folder of your project (haven't Dockerfile yet - just search or ask AI "create dockerfile for Node.js" or "create dockerfile for go"), etc.
- (Optional) Domain name

#### Deploy from local folders
In the root folder of your project on your local machine, run the following command
(replace <code>server_public_ip</code> with the IP of your server):
```
curl https://turbocloud.dev/deploy | bash -s -- -i server_public_ip
```
Once installation is complete, open <a href="https://console.turbocloud.dev">console.turbocloud.dev</a> in a browser to add and manage servers/apps/databases/localhost tunnels.


#### Deploy from GitHub and Bitbucket
Run the setup command on your development machine (replace <code>server_public_ip</code> with your server's IP address; SSH access to the server is required):
```
curl https://turbocloud.dev/quick-start | bash -s -- -i server_public_ip
```
Once installation is complete, open <a href="https://console.turbocloud.dev">console.turbocloud.dev</a> in a browser to add and manage servers/apps/databases/localhost tunnels.




### License

We like to keep everything as simple as possible, which is why the TurboCloud license consists of just four points:

- You can use TurboCloud (binaries and source code) for free, without any limitations, to deploy and manage projectsâ€”provided that neither your projects nor your company generate revenue.
- If your projects or company generate revenue, you need a TurboCloud commercial license (a one-time payment of USD 99) to deploy and manage projects. You can purchase the license at [turbocloud.dev](https://turbocloud.dev/).
- If you want to sell TurboCloud as a service (e.g., as a PaaS), you need a TurboCloud Reseller License. Contact us at [hey@turbocloud.dev](mailto:hey@turbocloud.dev) for more details.
- Redistribution in any form is not allowed.
