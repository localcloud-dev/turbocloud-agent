### License

We like to keep everything as simple as possible, which is why the TurboCloud license consists of just four points:

- You can use TurboCloud (binaries and source code) for free, without any limitations, to deploy and manage projectsâ€”provided that neither your projects nor your company generate revenue.
- If your projects or company generate revenue, you need a TurboCloud commercial license (a one-time payment of USD 100) to deploy and manage projects. You can purchase the license at [turbocloud.dev](https://turbocloud.dev/).
- If you want to sell TurboCloud as a service (e.g., as a PaaS), you need a TurboCloud Reseller License. Contact us at [hey@turbocloud.dev](mailto:hey@turbocloud.dev) for more details.
- Redistribution in any form is not allowed.
